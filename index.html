            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
              After the opening of AEO Powersports in Murrieta, CA in June 2019, we teamed up with former 
              factory WP Suspension tech Mark Johnson - also know as Research Engineering Performance, to 
              be our head suspension tech and tuner but also to broaden our reach and services around the 
              nation. All products made by R.E.P. are offered at all AEO Powersports locations for purchase.
